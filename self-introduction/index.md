Hello, my name is Marina, and now I am a housewife. I like reading, cooking, walking in the city, yoga-practice and living in a warm climate.

I have higher technical and economic education (Graduated from the Novosibirsk State Technical University in 2007). I worked as an accountant and tax inspector. I can work with deadlines, numbers, documents and people, perhaps working with people is the most difficult for me.
The English language I learned in school and university, I think I'm lucky with the teachers. I maintain my English level by reading books and watching films in the original.
Currently, I am studying to be a front-end developer. I decided to go into this profession after my children have grown up and I had free time for working. For me, programming has always been unknown and scary. Developers seem to me to be some kind of gifted super humans. The development process is like magic for me, when life appears on a blank slate: colors, shapes, interactivity, statistics.
Now it has become interesting for me to get into the area of my fear. I want to stir up my brains, do what I have never done and find a job that would be radically different from what I'm used to.
During my studies at RSSchool (I started in February 2022), I managed to learn HTML, CSS, the basics of JavaScript and Node.JS; I worked with GIT, VSCode, Google Chrome DevTools and terminal.
This educational process has become difficult and interesting for me. I consider my result worthy (уэзей) for myself. I didn’t have any background in development before the start of the course. And now I have written my first game… Wow!
After mastering the curriculum, I plan to develop mobile applications for large financial organizations or develop metaverses. Maybe I can work to create new games and NFT-tokens. Now these are distant dreams on my difficult path in the vast ocean of development.
This concludes my resume, thank you for your attention. I look forward to feedback and further cooperation. Bye-bye!
